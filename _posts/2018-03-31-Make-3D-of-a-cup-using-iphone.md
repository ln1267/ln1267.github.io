title: How to creat 3D maps using your phone  
excerpt: This is a try about using iphone to take photos of an item and creat a 3D model of it using Pix4D  
tags: UAV Pix4D 3D  
---

## Requirement
- A phone (definitely you have at leat one)
- A software can process photos. I used Pix4D here (with a license).
- For Pix4D you need a computer with at least 4GB or using their cloud process.

## Taking photos of an item
You need to take photos of this item in a cycle and make sure your photos have at least 70% overlap.

Tips:   
    1. Don't put too much informaiton in the backgroud  

## Import all photos to Pix4D and select "Pix4D 3D models"

This 3D map is not very good, but it captured most of the import features of the table and the cup in this image.
