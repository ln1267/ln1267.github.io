## Prerequisites
- A phone #  you definitely have at least one
- A software which can process photos. I used Pix4D in this post (with a licence).
- For Pix4D you need a computer with at least 4GB memory or use Pix4D's cloud platform.

## Taking photos of an item
You need to take photos of this item from different angles and make sure your photos have at least 70\% overlap.

Tips:   
    1. Have as little background interference as possible.

## Import all photos to Pix4D and select "Pix4D 3D models"

This 3D map is not very good but it captures most of the key features of the table and the cup.
